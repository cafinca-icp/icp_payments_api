# POS ICP Integration

## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope
This project focuses on integrating point of sale (POS) systems with the Internet Computer (ICP) protocol, allowing users to make payments using multiple cryptocurrencies. The goal is to simplify and secure transactions in a decentralized environment, with advanced features such as smart payments and enhanced transaction verification.

The development of this project has been funded by a grant from the DFINITY Foundation, enabling us to innovate in the area of decentralized payments.

### Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the following contributors for their invaluable support:

- **icp_hub mexico**: For their technical support and for facilitating community engagement, which has been crucial to the progress of the project.
- **Cafinca**: For implementing and operating our vending machines in Mexico and Chile, providing a real-world environment to test and refine our integration.
- **Community maintenance and participation**: We are grateful to Lazaro Roberto Luevano Serna and José de Jesús Bernal Muñoz for their ongoing code maintenance and active community involvement.

### Invitation to Contribute
We would love to see more people join the development of this project. The community is the driving force behind many innovations, and we are open to receiving your ideas, suggestions, and contributions. For those interested in contributing, please refer to our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for detailed guidelines on how to get involved. Your participation will not only help improve the project but also enrich the experience for everyone involved.

The core development team will continue to maintain and enhance the code, but we always welcome fresh perspectives from new contributors. Join us in this exciting technological journey!

## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm
- DFINITY Canister SDK (`dfx`)
- Python 3.11

#### Yarn Installation
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

#### Installing Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

### Formatting and Linting
To keep the code clean and consistent, run the following command:
```bash
npx prettier --write --plugin=prettier-plugin-motoko **/*.mo
```

### Local Project Deployment
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Start the local replica:**
   ```bash
   dfx start --clean --background
   ```

2. **Deploy the Internet Identity canister:**
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network local internet_identity
   ```

3. **Save the current Principal:**
   ```bash
   export OWNER=$(dfx identity get-principal)
   ```

4. **Deploy the ckBTC ledger canister:**
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network local --specified-id mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai icrc1_ledger --argument '
   (variant {
     Init = record {
       token_name = "Local ckBTC";
       token_symbol = "LCKBTC";
       minting_account = record {
         owner = principal "'${OWNER}'";
       };
       initial_balances = vec {
         record {
           record {
             owner = principal "'${OWNER}'";
           };
           100_000_000_000;
         };
       };
       metadata = vec {};
       transfer_fee = 10;
       archive_options = record {
         trigger_threshold = 2000;
         num_blocks_to_archive = 1000;
         controller_id = principal "'${OWNER}'";
       }
     }
   })
   '
   ```

5. **Deploy the index canister:**
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network local icrc1_index --argument 'opt variant { Init = record { ledger_id = principal "mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai"; } }'
   ```

6. **Deploy the pos-icp-integration-backend canister:**
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network local pos-icp-integration-backend --argument '(0)'
   ```

### Testing the Mainnet Canister with Python

1. **Create and activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the test:**
   ```bash
   python query_canister.py
   ```

The canister's source code and expected responses can be reviewed in `src/pos-icp-integration-backend/main.mo`.

### Future Improvements
Planned improvements include:

- **Multitoken Payment**: Support for multiple tokens such as ckBTC, ICP, ckETH, CLT, and others.
- **Enhanced Transaction Verification**: Implementation of more robust mechanisms for payment verification.
- **Smart Payments**: Support for multi-instruction transactions.

## Conclusion

This project represents a significant step towards integrating decentralized technologies into the payment space, with the potential to transform how we interact with digital transactions. The functionalities we are developing aim not only to provide a smooth and secure user experience but also to lay the groundwork for future innovations in the decentralized finance space.

Community collaboration is essential to the ongoing success of this project. Every contribution, whether in the form of code, ideas, or testing, brings us closer to a comprehensive solution that can be widely adopted. We are excited about what the future holds and look forward to seeing how this technology can evolve and adapt to new needs.

If you have ideas on how to improve the project or wish to get more involved, don't hesitate to join us. Together, we can make this POS-ICP integration not just a reality, but a powerful tool in the global digital ecosystem.
